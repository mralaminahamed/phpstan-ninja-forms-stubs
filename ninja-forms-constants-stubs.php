/**
 * Equation Operating System Classes.
 * 
 * This class was created for the safe parsing of mathematical equations
 * in PHP.  There is a need for a way to successfully parse equations
 * in PHP that do NOT require the use of `eval`.  `eval` at its core
 * opens the system using it to so many security vulnerabilities it is oft
 * suggested /never/ to use it, and for good reason.  This class set will
 * successfully take an equation, parse it, and provide solutions to the
 * developer.  It is a safe way to evaluate expressions without putting
 * the system at risk.
 *
 * 2013/04 UPDATE:
 * - Moved to native class functions for PHP5
 * - Removed deprecated `eregi` calls to `preg_match`
 * - Updated to PHPDoc comment syntax
 * - Added Exception throwing instead of silent exits
 * - Added additional variable prefix of '$', '&' is still allowed as well
 * - Fixed small implied multiplication problem
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Add factorial support. (ie 5! = 120)
